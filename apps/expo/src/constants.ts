 * NOTE: we recommend putting the publishable key here instead of in your .env
 * files for two reasons:
 * 1. It's okay for this to be "public" (CLERK_SECRET_KEY should
 *    NEVER be public)
 * 2. Parsing the .env file in Metro/Expo runs the risk of including the
 *    variables above that we don't want (and it's obnoxious to do right as a
 *    result)
